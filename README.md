# Hello there!  😄👋

My name is Genemes Souza, from Brazil. With more than 10 years of experience in developing highly scalable and available corporate solutions, I have worked significantly in the financial, healthcare, and telecommunications sectors.

In the financial sector, I played a crucial role in managing and processing transactions related to card receivables.
In the healthcare field, I had the privilege of working at the largest company in South America, focusing on telemedicine solutions driven by artificial intelligence.
In the telecommunications area, I focused my efforts on chip activations in the 5G network, contributing to the expansion of this next-generation technology.

In my free time, I'm with my family (👨‍👩‍👧‍👦). I enjoy watching football (⚽️), watching movies (🎞️), reading books (📚), listening to music (🎵), and occasionally playing football with friends (⚽️).
